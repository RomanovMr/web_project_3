**Intro**    
  
This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Features**  
  
In project were used:
BEM methodology
Flexbox
Grid
Pseudoclases hover and before
@media for different screen sizes
  
**Improve**  
  
More screen resolutions for smoother transition
Elongate grid for larger devices
